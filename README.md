# TER: Graph Neural Networks for glassy dynamics modelling


## Members:
- Etienne Efoe Blavo
- Diego Andres Torres Guarin

## Description:
This repository contains the code used throughout the TER, from the first explorations with Pytorch geometric and toy datasets to the model used to try to replicate the results of the DeepMind paper.

The actual computations were performed on Kaggle, uploading the notebooks and necessary utility scripts.
